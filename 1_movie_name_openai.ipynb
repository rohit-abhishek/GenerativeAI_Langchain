    "On 30 December 1999, Minister of External Affairs Devavrat Kapoor and Director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajay Sanyal negotiate with terrorist Zahoor Mistry to release three terrorists, including his brother, and pay a ransom of $10 million USD in exchange for the lives of airline passengers held captive in Kandahar. Chief of R&AW K. S. Bhullar rejects Sanyal's proposal to infiltrate terrorist networks in Pakistan, but after the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, Kapoor approves Sanyal's \"Operation Dhurandhar\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanyal deploys agent Hamza Ali Mazari to Pakistan via Afghanistan. Upon reaching Lyari, Karachi, Hamza meets Mohammed Aalam, a juice shop owner, moves in with him, and works as a waiter, learning about gangster Rehman Dakait and rival leaders. As a Baloch, Hamza can join only Rehman's gang which is led by Rehman and his second-in-command and first cousin Uzair Baloch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamza and Aalam learn that a rival Pathan gang led by Rehman's estranged father, Babu Dakait, plans to kill Rehman's eldest son, Naieem Baloch. The next day, Babu's men attack a wedding attended by Naieem and his younger brother Faizal; Hamza saves Faizal Baloch, but Naieem is killed. At the hospital, Hamza meets Rehman and his cousin Uzair Baloch, who recruits him after noting his firearm expertise. Jameel Jamali of the Pakistan Awami Party (PAP) warns Uzair not to retaliate before the Lyari election. While embedded with the gang, Hamza learns of their illegal production of unlicensed firearms. On Hamza's advice, Rehman Dakait decides to avenge Naieem's murder. Hamza, Uzair, and the gang kill Babu's men; Rehman Dakait murders Babu by smashing his head with a weighing stone, declaring Baloch rule in Lyari.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rehman attends a PAP rally held by Jameel. Hamza meets Jameel Jamali's daughter Yalina Jamali at the event and later begins a relationship with her. Rehman Dakait is introduced to Major Iqbal, an ISI official, by the Khanani brothers, businessmen who encourage Rehman Dakait to enter politics. Iqbal asks him to supply weapons and ammunition. During dealings, Hamza watches Iqbal brutally torture an Indian spy and learns of his counterfeit-currency operation with the Khananis. Hamza relays this to Aalam, who informs Sanyal; the IB suspects Pakistan possesses Indian currency plates. While transporting weapons, Hamza discovers plans for a major attack on India and passes the intel to the IB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rehman's partnership with the Khananis sidelines Jameel from Lyari politics. Rehman enters into the politics with help of Major Iqbal of ISI and Khananis. Rehman declares alliance of his party People's Aman Committee with PAP of Aquib Ali Zarwari. Jameel Jamali, then enlists suspended Superintendent of Police (SP) Chaudhary Aslam to eliminate Rehman Dakait. SP Chaudhry Aslam suggests creation of Lyari Task Force for the elimination of Rehman and his gang from Lyari. Aslam arrests Rehman while Hamza is on a weapons run. Hamza sends Jameel a video recorded by Yalina exposing Jameel's collusion with Aslam and gangster Arshad Pappu, whom Jameel promised control of Lyari. Jameel sends the video to Aslam, demanding Rehman's release; Aslam initially refuses, but capitulates after Hamza sends him a livestream of himself and Uzair torturing officers from Aslam's Lyari Task Force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the warnings, the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks occur, devastating Hamza as he watches live TV coverage with Rehman and Iqbal's gangs. Enraged at their failure to prevent the attacks, Hamza and Aalam resolve to expose and dismantle Pakistan's terror network. He secretly approaches Jameel with a plan to rule Lyari after marrying Yalina, giving Jameel long-term influence through family ties. Hamza then strikes a deal with Jameel and Aslam to eliminate Rehman.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Hamza and Yalina's wedding, Iqbal asks Rehman Dakait for another weapons shipment. Rehman tells Hamza to check his calendar; exploiting Rehman's drunkenness, Hamza schedules the delivery for the same day as another event Rehman must attend, creating an ambush window for SP Chaudhry Aslam.\n",
    "\n",
    "On 9 August 2009, Hamza sends an unsuspecting Uzair Baloch to the shipment rendezvous point while he drives Rehman and his men to an apparent meeting that is actually Aslam's ambush site. Near the location, Rehman realizes Hamza's betrayal, triggering a violent fight inside the car. Hamza crashes the vehicle and flees into the woods as SP Aslam arrives. SP Aslam pursues Rehman while his officers kill Donga, Rehman's henchman, in a firefight. Hamza kills Rehman's other henchman, Shaukat, and then helps Aslam overpower and critically injure Rehman Dakait. Hamza transports Rehman Dakait to a hospital under the guise of helping him; Rehman succumbs to his injuries soon after, and Hamza's role in his death remains unknown to Uzair Baloch and the others as they arrive at the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamza's true identity is revealed as Jaskirat Singh Rangi, an Indian death-row inmate from Indian Punjab trained as a covert agent for Ajay's operation. With Rehman Dakait eliminated, he plans to target \"Bade Sahab\", the mastermind and orchestrator of several Pakistani terror attacks, while consolidating power in Lyari.\n",
